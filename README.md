==========

MultiCount is a Pebble application that allows you to manage simple counters.

This is the first Pebble app I made, so the code may not have the best structure or follow all guidelines, but it works and I think it's not too bad. Please [send me any feedback](http://twitter.com/GilDev) to improve this app!
